# Detailed Project Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the "PimpmycaseV2" project, including its implemented features, technology stack, and a deep dive into the design customization flow.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js 14.2.16 (React)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with `postcss`, `clsx`, and `tailwind-merge`.
*   **UI Components:** `shadcn/ui` and Radix UI primitives.
*   **Form Handling:** `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
*   **Theming:** `next-themes`.
*   **Analytics:** `@vercel/analytics`.

## Implemented Features and Pages

### Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)

The landing page of the application. It features a hero section with a call-to-action to "Start Designing", a section for "Featured Collections", and a section highlighting the key features of the service (Easy Design, Premium Quality, etc.). The page is visually appealing with background blobs and a clean layout.

### Templates Page (`app/templates/page.tsx`)

This page allows users to browse a gallery of pre-designed templates. It includes features for:

*   **Searching:** Users can search for templates by name or tags.
*   **Filtering:** Users can filter templates by category.
*   **Sorting:** Users can sort templates by popularity and price.
*   **Favorites:** Users can mark templates as favorites.
*   **Previews:** Hovering over a template shows options to "Quick View" or "Use Template".

### Navigation (`components/navigation.tsx`)

The navigation bar is a key component that provides links to all the main pages of the application. It's responsive and has a mobile-friendly version with a sheet-based menu. It includes links to Home, Design, Templates, Products, and About, as well as actions for Cart, Sign In, and "Start Designing".

### Authentication (`app/login/page.tsx`, `app/signup/page.tsx`, `app/admin/login/page.tsx`)

The project has a basic setup for user and admin authentication. The pages exist, but the actual implementation of the authentication logic is not visible in the provided code.

### E-commerce Flow (`app/products/page.tsx`, `app/cart/page.tsx`, `app/checkout/page.tsx`)

The project has the basic pages for a standard e-commerce flow. The product page is set up to display a list of products, and there are pages for the shopping cart and checkout process. The checkout process also has a loading and success page.

### User Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

A page for the user dashboard exists, but the content and functionality are not yet implemented.

## Deep Dive: The "Design" Flow (`app/customize/page.tsx`)

The `app/customize/page.tsx` file contains the core logic for the phone case customization process. It's a multi-step flow that guides the user through creating their own design. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the user's journey:

### Step 1: Choose Programme

*   **What the user sees:** The user is presented with two main options: "Photo Case" and "Say It!". There's also an option to "Browse Trending Designs".
*   **User action:** The user selects one of the options to start the design process.

### Step 2: Upload Photo (for "Photo Case" flow)

*   **What the user sees:** A large upload area with a "Choose Photo" button.
*   **User action:** The user can either drag and drop an image or click the button to upload a photo from their device. Once uploaded, a preview of the image is shown.

### Step 3: Use As

*   **What the user sees:** The user is asked how they want to use the uploaded image: as a "Background" or as a "Sticker".
*   **User action:** The user selects one of the two options.

### Step 4: Stickers & Background

*   **What the user sees:** Depending on the previous choice, the user can add stickers to their design and/or choose a background. There's a list of pre-defined stickers and backgrounds, and an option to upload a custom background.
*   **User action:** The user can add stickers and select a background for their design.

### Step 5: Customisation

*   **What the user sees:** This step allows the user to fine-tune their design. They can adjust the photo shape (original, circle, square), and for each element (image or sticker), they can control its size and rotation.
*   **User action:** The user can select an element and use the sliders to adjust its properties. They can also delete elements.

### Step 6: Preview & Finalize

*   **What the user sees:** A summary of their design, including the selected programme, phrase (if any), and the number of elements. There are also buttons to "Save Design", "Share", and "Add to Cart".
*   **User action:** The user can review their design and proceed to the checkout or save their design for later.

### "Say It!" Flow

If the user chooses the "Say It!" programme, the flow is slightly different:

*   **Step 2: Phrase Selection:** The user can choose from a list of pre-defined phrases or type their own.
*   **Step 3: AI Styling:** The user can choose an AI-powered style (e.g., Graffiti, Neon, Vintage) to apply to their chosen phrase.

### "Trending" Flow

If the user chooses to browse trending designs, they are taken to a page where they can see a list of popular designs and load a preset to start their customization.

## UI and Component Library

The project makes extensive use of `shadcn/ui` and Radix UI, which provides a solid foundation for building a modern and accessible user interface. The UI is clean, consistent, and follows modern design trends. The use of these libraries allows for rapid development of high-quality UI components.
